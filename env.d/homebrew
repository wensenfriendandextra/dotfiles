# To be clear: I'm not against Homebrew collecting analytics. I turned
# analytics only because I have some brew-related scripts that could run many
# brew commands in quick succession, and opening one curl process for each of
# them adversely affects performance. If analytics is collected only when
# stdout/stderr is connected to a tty, I'm more than happy to turn it back on.
